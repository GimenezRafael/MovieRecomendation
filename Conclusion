We can see that the recommendation system was able to recommend movies based on the ratings of other users with similar tastes to the selected user.
Recommendations include comedy movies, which is the selected user's favorite genre, as well as other genres like musical, adventure, drama, and crime.

Conclusion:
In this project, we implement a movie recommendation system using item-based collaborative filtering algorithm and cosine similarity
The system was tested for a randomly selected user and was able to recommend movies based on the ratings of other users with similar tastes.
