# MovieRecomendationSystem

Objective: Develop a movie recommendation system, similar to the one used by Netflix, that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their viewing histories and preferences.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask libraries.

Step 1: Data Collection and Cleaning

Collect movie data, including information such as genre, director, actors, synopsis, and rating;
Collect user data, including viewing history and preferences;
Clean the data, handling missing values and inconsistencies.

Step 2: Data Analysis and Visualization

Analyze the collected data, identifying trends and patterns;
Visualize the data using charts and tables, using the Matplotlib library.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the data, transforming the information into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms;
Use the Pandas library to transform the data into a tabular format, with each movie represented by a row and each attribute represented by a column.

Step 4: Selection of Machine Learning Algorithms

Select the most appropriate machine learning algorithms for the problem, such as clustering algorithms and collaborative filtering;
Use the Scikit-learn library to implement the algorithms.

Step 5: Model Training

Train the recommendation model using the preprocessed data;
Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

Step 6: Implementation of the Recommendation System

Implement the recommendation system using the Flask library, allowing users to input their preferences and receive movie suggestions based on their viewing histories.

Step 7: Evaluation and System Tuning

Evaluate the accuracy of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision and recall;
Tune the recommendation system by making changes to the algorithms and parameters used.
